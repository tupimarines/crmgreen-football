# Project Analysis and Implementation Plan

## Understanding the Project Requirements

Based on the audio transcript and folder structure, I understand that:

1. There are two projects:
   - **Football**: The main project we need to modify
   - **CRM Green Sinais**: Contains CSS styling and WhatsApp API integration to be used as reference

2. Core Requirements:
   - Copy CSS styling from the CRM to the Football project
   - Create/fix a Configuration page for users
   - Integrate WhatsApp API to send table data (similar to existing CRM implementation)
   - Fix user access/permissions
   - Generate ODD tables that receive data from an API

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Analysis (2 days)
1. Set up local development environment
   ```
   git clone <repository>
   cd football
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Analyze both codebases:
   - Understand the Football project structure
   - Study the CRM's CSS implementation and WhatsApp API

- **Total Project Timeline**: 20 working days (4 weeks)

If you need to prioritize, focus on:
1. CSS implementation
2. Configuration page development
3. WhatsApp API integration
4. User access fixes
5. ODD tables generation

## Technical Requirements

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Python 3.8+
   - Django 4.0+
   - Node.js 14+ (for WhatsApp API)
   - PostgreSQL database

2. **Key Libraries**:
   - WhatsApp API: `@whiskeysockets/baileys`
   - Express.js for API server
   - Django REST framework for backend APIs

3. **Deployment Requirements**:
   - Docker containers (as seen in the docker-compose files)
   - Nginx for web server
